# LGBTQ+ Meet
### My Flatiron School Final Project
 
 ### This repository includes *both* the frontend, and backend (in their respective directories). For the functional Heroku hosted version, visit: [LGBTQ-Meet Link](https://lgbtq-meetups.herokuapp.com/) 
### [See Heroku-Hosted Frontend Repository](https://github.com/boostinwrx/lgtbtq-meetups-frontend)

 This branch will soon become obsolete and the old front-end repo (which is no longer current, see above link for frontend) will be removed. [**See updated *`repository`* branch in progress.**](https://github.com/boostinwrx/LGBTQ-meetup-app/tree/refactor)

 #### App Description:
* Finally, a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community to create and find social meetups with gender affirming, supportive people near you!
  
* Everyone, no matter their sexual preference or gender identity, are welcome. Here, users can find meetups near them to hang out with like-minded people. Creating a meetup is effortless. Simply create an account, and create a custom meetup with a title, description, map location, date/time, and even a category (ex.transgender/lesbian/non-binary, etc.).
